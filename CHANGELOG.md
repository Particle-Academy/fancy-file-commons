## [Unreleased]

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING — Node 22 is now declared as the floor.** `engines.node` is `>=22`, where this package previously declared **nothing at all**.

  Declaring nothing was not the same as supporting old Node: a consumer on 18 installed cleanly and found out at runtime.

  **What you must do:** on Node 22 or newer, nothing. Note npm only *warns* on an `engines` mismatch while **pnpm fails the install**, so this surfaces differently depending on your package manager. Node 18 is end-of-life and 20 is maintenance-only.

### Why

These are the kit 0.5 platform floors, applied across every package at once so a consumer never has to resolve a mix. **No API changed, nothing was removed, nothing was renamed** — only what the package requires.


## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **syntax:** add pure highlight primitives (tokenizer, highlightCode, HTML grammar, palettes)

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- security sweep — linear cleanPath + patched esbuild (v0.1.1)

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-04

### Added

- fancy-file-commons — shared pure core for the Fancy file packages
